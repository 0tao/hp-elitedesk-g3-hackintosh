Clover config for HP Elitedesk G3 machines

- Tested on 10.15 (Catalina

- Tested on 10.14 (Mojave)

## Important
```
Those machines come with a Samsung PM981 NVME SSD which is *NOT* compatible 
(installing hackintosh on those is not possible, maybe with cloning an existing
installed hackintosh with Carbon Copy Cloner would be possible, but its risky)

I switched mine to an ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro which is compatible.

Also
While installing hackintosh it was necessary to use intel inject with 0x19120000 id and
after installation it can be removed.
